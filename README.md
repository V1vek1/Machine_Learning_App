# Machine_Learning_App
I'm happy to share that I've built a face detection app using #Google's Machine Learning Kit.
This was a #challenging and rewarding project, and I learned a lot about machine learning and Android development in the process.

Google's Machine Learning Kit is a powerful set of tools that make it easy to add machine learning capabilities to your Android apps. 
The face detection API is one of the most popular features in ML Kit, and it's incredibly easy to use.

To build my face detection app,
ðŸš€I simply needed to add the ML Kit dependency to my project and import the face detection API.
ðŸš€I created a camera preview and used the ML Kit face detector to detect faces in the preview.
ðŸš€Once a face is detected, I drew a bounding box around it.

I'm really happy with how my face detection app turned out. It's simple to use and works well. 
I'm also proud of the fact that I was able to build it using my own skills and knowledge.
This is My First Machine Learning App.

The Functionality of this App:-

1. Open Your Camera App
2. Take a Picture of a Person/Group of peoples
3. then it will give the Smile Percentage and Both Eyes Opening Percentage
4. Done
